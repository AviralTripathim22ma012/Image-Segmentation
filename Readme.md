# Semantic Segmentation using U-Net

Welcome to the Semantic Segmentation using U-Net project! This project focuses on implementing semantic segmentation using the U-Net architecture, a popular convolutional neural network (CNN) model for image segmentation tasks.

## Overview
Semantic segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into multiple segments, each representing a specific object or region. U-Net is a fully convolutional network architecture designed for biomedical image segmentation but widely adopted in various image segmentation tasks due to its effectiveness.

## Features
- Implementation of the U-Net architecture for semantic segmentation.
- Training the model on labeled image datasets for various segmentation tasks.
- Evaluation of model performance using standard evaluation metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and pixel accuracy.
- Fine-tuning and transfer learning to adapt the model to specific segmentation tasks.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Prepare your dataset: Ensure your dataset is labeled with ground truth segmentation masks.
3. Preprocess your data: Normalize images, resize them to a standard size, and split into training and validation sets.
4. Train the U-Net model using the provided scripts or notebooks.
5. Evaluate the trained model on the validation set.
6. Fine-tune the model or perform transfer learning as needed for your specific task.

## Usage
- Train the U-Net model using labeled image datasets.
- Use the trained model to perform semantic segmentation on new images.
- Evaluate the performance of the model using standard evaluation metrics.
